              plant new roots began its development in April 2024 by glendon chin, a Korean/Chinese American who's currently writing this in the third person right now (so now i'll just switch to first person pov). put simply, learning a language (or multiple) will carry different meanings for each of us. as an example, i am currently studying korean right now and one of the goals that i am hellbent on reaching is being able to speak with my grandma whose first language isn't english. there's more to it, but i'll just leave it there for now. i knew it wouldn't be easy, but somewhere along the way i felt like with the growth of technology, we can create more intuitive resources to help us on our own language journeys :)
